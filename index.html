                <h5 class="hh name">About Me</h5>
                <p>I am a young, energetic techie in the Kenyan Tech scene who is not only passionate about building great products, 
                    but also a guy who enjoys helping the community. I am a graduate of JKUAT, BSc. Mathematics and Computer Science, 
                    class of 2018. Besides the degree, I also possess several certificates in Data Analytics, Cyber Security, Data Science and Engineering.
                </p>
                <h5 class="hh name">Why Tech</h5>
                <p>From a young age, both at home and school, I was always fascinated by computers. All my leisure time was spent in the company 
                    of computers playing games, browsing, etc. This passion led me to pursue studies in computers. <br>
                    As for me, I wanted to be able to digitise processes in our country since most services in this country are done physically 
                    thus making service delivery inefficient. I also want to build projects that help my community. With these as my drivers, I took 
                    the tech route since I was well conversant with the computer world. <br>
                    To date, I have been able to do this, though at a small scale, and my aim is to improve the lives of Kenyans via tech products.
